# Snapshot Testing

This example demonstrates invoking a test case for each file in the "data" directory.
The expected output files are stored in the "data/snapshots" directory. The snapshots
directory is programmatically generated if it doesn't exist. The expected output files,
known as snapshots, are also programmatically generated if they don't exist.

This example is based on the file-driven testing example, however, snapshot testing
has less maintenance as the expected output files (the snapshots) are programmatically
generated rather than manually created. All snapshots can be regenerated by deleting
the "snapshots" directory and re-running the test.
