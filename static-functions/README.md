# Static Function Testing

This example demonstrates a strategy for static function testing.
Static functions do not have external linkage and are only visible to the compilation unit that defines them.

One way to test static functions is to combine your unit tests with your source code.
This example demonstrates that you can test static functions from separate source files by including the source file into the test file.
